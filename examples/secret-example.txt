Initiate Protocol Chimera. The hour is approaching. You must retrieve the Sunstone Key from the vault beneath the Old Clock Tower, specifically the seventh false brick from the base of the north wall. This object holds the complete schema for Operation Cerberus and must not fall into unauthorized hands.

Your contact, codenamed 'Aether,' awaits your arrival at the designated rendezvous point: the solitary Willow tree at the confluence of the Rivers Styx and Lethe—a location known only by the inner circle. He will provide the necessary access codes. You must approach him under the pretense of seeking rare botanical specimens; use the passphrase, “The harvest moon casts no shadow.” His reply will be, “Only in the gardens of the Emperor.”

Be warned: surveillance has been heightened following the incident at Sector Gamma. Trust no one who offers assistance without first validating their three-point cipher. The transmission window is closing. The package must be secured before dawn. Success depends entirely upon your discretion and speed. Fail and the consequence is irreversible.
